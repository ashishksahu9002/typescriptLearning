  - What does "strict": true enable in TypeScript?
    - Enables strict type-checking (e.g., noImplicitAny, strictNullChecks).

    - Compile-time = caught by TS before running; runtime = JS crashes only when executed.

  - What happens when you run tsc with "rootDir": "./src" and "outDir": "./dist"?
    - TS compiles all .ts files in src/ → outputs .js into dist/.

  - Why does console.log(greet(42)) fail if greet expects a string parameter?
